## Samples for the Code-lib Framework

Under this Repository you can find a selection of **<a href="https://github.com/ferndev/code-lib">Code-lib</a> (or CL for short)** samples that demonstrate how to easily get started with the 
framework, and how to quickly take advantage of specific CL features to develop PHP Applications that are robust 
and easy to create and maintain.
You can also read more about Code-lib at the <a href="http://codelibfw.com/">Code-Lib website</a>.

While Code-lib itself is released under a LGPL license, each of the samples is released under the **Apache License**.
**You are free to use any of these samples as a starting point for any project, personal or commercial, whether open 
source or not**.

To get started:

- download the samples to a folder in your computer available to your web server, for instance inside _htdocs_ or _public_html_.
- download **code-lib**, and copy the path to where you installed it in your computer.
- for each sample you want to execute, open its **index.php** file and update **CL_DIR** with the correct path for your
  installation of code-lib.
- read the README.md file for the sample so you understand better what it does.
- open the url pointing to the index.php file of that sample in your web browser.
