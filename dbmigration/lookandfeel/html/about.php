                <h2>Schema Migration</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">This sample shows a simplistic representation of an App evolving along time,
                to showcase how Code-lib can help with schema migration as your Application's schema evolves</p>
                <div>It shows a fictitious use case where Articles must be written and saved to a database for later use.<br>
                Along the way, a few changes will take place which will impact data entry and storage</div>
                <div>
                    In this sample, there are 3 different phases, representing 3 different timelines:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Phase 1: 2 weeks into development, when architecture, initial development and database schema are put in place.<br>
                            You can trigger it by running: <a class="btn btn-dark btn-xl js-scroll-trigger" href="index.php?timeline=2weeks">2 weeks into development</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Phase 2: 4 weeks into development, when architecture, initial development and database schema are put in place.<br>
                            You can trigger it by running: <a class="btn btn-dark btn-xl js-scroll-trigger" href="index.php?timeline=4weeks">4 weeks into development</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>Phase 3: 6 weeks into development, when architecture, initial development and database schema are put in place.<br>
                            You can trigger it by running: <a class="btn btn-dark btn-xl js-scroll-trigger" href="index.php?timeline=6weeks">6 weeks into development</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
